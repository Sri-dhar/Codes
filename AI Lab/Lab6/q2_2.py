'''
Implement the Simulated Annealing algorithm to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem
(TSP) for a given set of cities and their distances.
Requirements:
(a) Given a set of cities and their distances, define a function to represent the TSP objective.
(b) Implement the Simulated Annealing algorithm to find the shortest tour that visits each city
exactly once and returns to the starting city.
(c) Experiment with a different initial temperature, cooling rate and number of iterations to
observe their effects on the algorithmâ€™s performance.
