Version A (Random Initialization)

    Initial centroids are chosen randomly from the dataset
    No prior knowledge of class labels is used
    Each run may produce different results due to random initialization
    More susceptible to getting stuck in local optima

Version B (Label-based Initialization)

    Initial centroids are chosen from labeled samples
    One centroid from each known class
    Deterministic initialization (same starting points each run)
    Leverages domain knowledge through labeled samples

2. Expected Output Differences
Sum-Square-Error (SSE)

    Version A:
        Generally higher SSE values
        More variable SSE across different runs
        May require multiple runs to find optimal clustering
        Higher chance of suboptimal solutions
    Version B:
        Generally lower SSE values
        More consistent SSE across runs
        Single run usually sufficient
        Better chance of finding global optimum

Silhouette Coefficient

    Version A:
        More variable silhouette scores
        Might show lower average scores
        Results heavily dependent on initialization luck
    Version B:
        More consistent silhouette scores
        Generally higher average scores
        Better cluster separation due to informed initialization

Number of Iterations

    Version A:
        Generally requires more iterations
        More variable convergence time
        May need multiple restarts
        Different iteration counts across runs
    Version B:
        Usually requires fewer iterations
        More consistent convergence time
        Single run typically sufficient
        Similar iteration counts across runs

3. Performance Characteristics
Clustering Quality

    Version A:
        Clusters might not align well with actual classes
        More exploratory in nature
        Could discover unexpected patterns
        Results vary between runs
    Version B:
        Clusters more likely to align with actual classes
        More supervised in nature
        Better at finding known class structures
        Consistent results between runs

Stability

    Version A:
        Less stable across multiple runs
        Requires multiple initializations
        Results need to be averaged
        Higher standard deviation in metrics
    Version B:
        More stable across runs
        Single initialization often sufficient
        More reproducible results
        Lower standard deviation in metrics

4. Practical Implications
When to Use Version A

    No prior knowledge of classes
    Exploratory data analysis
    Looking for natural groupings
    When multiple runs are feasible

When to Use Version B

    Some labeled samples available
    Need for consistent results
    Time constraints
    When alignment with known classes is important

5. Expected Results for IRIS Dataset
For K=3 (matching actual classes)

    Version A:
        SSE: Higher and variable (e.g., 60-80)
        Silhouette: 0.55-0.65 (variable)
        Iterations: 8-15 (variable)
    Version B:
        SSE: Lower and consistent (e.g., 50-60)
        Silhouette: 0.65-0.75 (consistent)
        Iterations: 5-8 (consistent)

Note: These numbers are approximate and will vary based on specific implementations and random seeds.
