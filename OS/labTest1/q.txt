Question

Write a program in which a parent process creates two child processes. The two child processes
communicate using one pipe and one child process and the parent process communicate using another
pipe.
One process takes input characters from user using ‘while (1)’ loop or ‘do while(1)’ and write it to a pipe.
As it is while(1), the loop will never end and every time an input number is given it will be written to the
pipe.
Another child process will take characters from the pipe and increment these by one and write to the
second pipe. This will again be done in a ‘while (1)’ loop or ‘do while (1)’ loop.
The parent process will take characters from the second pipe and decrement it by one and print the
characters received from the second pipe. If an ‘end of file’ is received, the parent process terminates
both child processes and displays “Child processes terminated” and then exits.
After one increment and one decrement, the same characters are obtained. So input characters and the
same as output characters.
